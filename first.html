    <p style="color: aqua;"> Git is an open-source distributed version control system.<br>
         It is designed to handle minor to major projects with high speed and efficiency. 
         <Br>It is developed to co-ordinate the work among the developers.<br>
         The version control allows us to track and work together with
         our team members at the same workspace.</p>
